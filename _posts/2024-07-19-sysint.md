What is Computer?


The computer is a super-intelligent electronic device that can perform tasks, process information, and store data. It takes the data as an input and processes that data to perform tasks under the control of a program and produces the output.

Inside a pc:
 
1)	Power supply.
2)	Expansion slots.
3)	5.25 drive bays.
4)	3.5 drive bays.

MOTHER Board:

1)Back panel connectors: Connectors and ports for connecting the computer to external devices such as display ports, audio ports, USB ports, Ethernet ports, PS/2 ports etc. See image below for a close-up view.

2)Cpu In cpu socket
 
3) Memory in memory slots

4)Storage devices

Functional units:

 
Binary formats: 

•	In computer each and every thing is stored in binary form i.e a sequence of 0 and 1.
•	The components of computers understand only binary formats.
•	This is the fundamental language of computers, as they use electrical signals that can be either on (1) or off (0).
•	For example, the number 5 in binary is represented as 101.
Here's how you can convert it:
1.	The rightmost digit represents 2^0 (1). Since it's 1, we add 1 to our total.
2.	The middle digit represents 2^1 (2). Since it's 0, we add nothing.
3.	The leftmost digit represents 2^2 (4). Since it's 1, we add 4 to our total.
So, 4 + 0 + 1 = 5, which is the decimal equivalent of the binary number 101.

Execution in computer:

•	Execution in computers refers to the process where a computer carries out instructions.
            Here's a simplified explanation:
1.	Fetch: The Central Processing Unit (CPU) fetches the instruction from its memory. This is done by the Program Counter (PC) which holds the memory address of the next instruction to be executed. Once fetched, the PC is incremented to point to the next instruction.
2.	Decode: The fetched instruction is then decoded in the Instruction Register. The CPU, through its control unit, interprets the instruction and prepares the CPU to execute it. This may involve fetching further bytes of data if the instruction requires it.
3.	Execute: The execution phase is where the operation is performed. This could be an arithmetic operation, a data movement instruction, a control instruction, or some other operation. The execution process is carried out by the appropriate component of the CPU - for example, the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) for arithmetic operations..
4.	Store: The result of the operation is stored back in memory or in a register, depending on the instruction.
This cycle is repeated for each instruction in the program until the program ends. The speed at which these cycles can be completed is a major factor in the overall speed of a computer.
Assembly Language:
•	Assembly language is a low-level programming language that is specific to a particular computer architecture.
•	It is one step away from machine language, which is the binary code executed directly by the computer's CPU.
•	In assembly language, instructions are written in a mnemonic code, making it slightly easier to understand and work with than raw binary code.
•	Each line of assembly code typically represents a single CPU instruction or operation. 
•	This gives the programmer very direct control over the computer's hardware, but it also makes the code more complex and harder to write and understand than higher-level languages.
•	Here's a simple example of what assembly code might look like:
	MOV AX, 10
	MOV BX, AX
	ADD AX, BX
Types Of Files in computer:
There are many types of files that a computer can store, and they are typically identified by their file extensions. Here are a few common ones:
1.	Text Files (.txt): These are simple files that contain plain text.
2.	Document Files (.doc, .docx, .pdf): These are files created by word processors like Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat.
3.	Image Files (.jpg, .png, .gif): These files store image data.
4.	Audio Files (.mp3, .wav): These files store sound data.
5.	Video Files (.mp4, .avi): These files store video data.
6.	Executable Files (.exe, .app): These files contain programs that can be run by the computer.
Each of these file types requires a specific program to open and interpret the data correctly.
Hex Editor: A hex editor is a type of computer program that allows for manipulation of the fundamental binary (0s and 1s) data that constitutes a file.
    In a hex editor, each byte (8 bits) of binary data is represented as a two-digit hexadecimal number. Hex editors are useful for debugging, data recovery, or understanding the structure and layout of a file at the lowest level.
Operating system:
•	It picks up the input given in user and stored in appropriate locations in a memory.
•	It also picks up a result of computations from memory and displays it to the user.
•	It does many jobs like interactions bwn the user and computer.
•	Examples: windows, linux, ios.
For example:
Sum of two numbers

#include <cs50.h>
#include “ my folder ”

int main(void)
{
    int number1;
    int number2;
    int sum;

    number1 = get_int("Enter the first number: ");
    number2 = get_int("Enter the second number: ");
    sum = number1 + number2;

    printf("The sum of %i, %i is %i /n", number1, number2, sum);
}

If we give in #include “ my folder ”
it search in our folder name where it exists 
#include < my folder >
It will search in  /user/include directory

Compiler:
A C compiler is a program that turns C code into machine code, which can be executed by a computer
There are many c compilers. One which we use is clang.

.s file: The .s file is often created as an intermediary step in the compilation process, between the C source code and the final executable file
.o file: A .o file is an object file, which is produced as an output when you compile your C source code.
An .o file is an object file. It's created when a C compiler like gcc or clang compiles your source code. It contains machine code, but it's not yet executable. The linker uses these .o files to create the final executable program. 
 If you have multiple source files, each one will be compiled into its own .o file, and then all of them will be linked together.

Example program on pointer:
#include <cs50.h>
#include<stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int n = 10;
    int * ptr = &n; // int pointer ptr = ADDRESS_of(n)
    printf("%i\n", *ptr); //ptr ------ ACTUAL_VALUE(ptr)
    return 0;

}
